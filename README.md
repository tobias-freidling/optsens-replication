This repository contains the source code for the plots and simulations in the paper *Optimization-based Sensitivity Analysis for Unmeasured Confounding using Partial Correlations*,
available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00040). The optimization algorithm and visualization tools are implemented in the R-package [limosa.beta](https://github.com/tobias-freidling/limosa.beta).
